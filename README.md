Oil Catch Tank Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032
Oil Catch Tanks are essential components designed to capture excess oil, fuel vapors, and contaminants that escape from an engine's crankcase ventilation system. They play a crucial role in preventing carbon buildup inside the intake manifold, which can lead to reduced engine performance over time. These tanks are particularly beneficial for direct-injected engines, where oil blow-by is a common issue. By trapping these contaminants, Oil Catch Tanks enhance engine efficiency, prolong engine lifespan, and contribute to better fuel economy.
